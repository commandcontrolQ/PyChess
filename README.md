## Troubleshooting

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\foo\bar\pychess.py", line 253, in <module>
    import pygame
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pygame'
```
You will get this error if you do not have pygame installed.
To install pygame, run the command `pip install pygame`.
> If that command does not run, try using `py -m pip install pygame`, `python -m pip install pygame`, or `python310 -m pip install pygame`.
>
> If you already have installed pygame, then you likely have more than one installation of Python, and they are conflicting. **Make sure that you run the program using the version of Python that pygame was installed onto!**
